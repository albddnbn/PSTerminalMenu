## This function will just be a wrapper that runs functions from here: https://github.com/dwj7738/PowershellModules/blob/master/PSImageTools/Get-Image.ps1
## To Get-Image with image as target and pipe it into the ConvertTo-Bitmap function.

## I just used it to convert a png to bmp so I could set a background picture with bginfo64.exe / SysInternals, and I've had to do this before so this function will come in handy again.
