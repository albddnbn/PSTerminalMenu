## About <a name = "about"></a>

The 'menu.ps1' script uses the PS-Menu Powershell module (https://github.com/chrisseroka/ps-menu) to generate a series of interactive terminal menus.
First, the category menu is shown - it shows the categories of functions available. Once a category is selected, the functions in that category are shown in the second menu.

The script tries to take into account any parameters an added function might have - but as of now it ignores some of the common parameters, and hasn't been tested with a wide variety of functions (6/20/2023).
