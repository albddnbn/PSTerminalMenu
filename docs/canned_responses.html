            <h4>'Canned responses' can be useful for a variety of purposes - most notably - you can create templates for
                common responses to issues that come up frequently to help you respond more efficiently. For ex: if
                there are a lot of users dealing with a calendar-related issue in Outlook that's able to be resolved
                through same process - you can create a canned response here to include a variable for the user's name.

            <p><b>Ideas for improvement - ability to insert pictures into canned responses easily when using
                    New-CannedResponse.</b></p>
            <p>The terminal menu can copy custom 'canned responses' to the user's clipboard, while prompting the user to
                enter values for any variables contained in the response file.</p>
            <p>The menu is also able to generate new canned response files based on user input.</p>

                <p>A canned response is an HTML file that you can quickly personalize and copy to clipboard, to
                    efficiently respond to common IT Support Tickets.</p>
                <p><b>Once you've copied the response to clipboard, you have to click the 'code' button in OSTicket
                        before pasting if the canned response contains HTML.</b></p>
                <p>Text content can be pasted directly into response textbox without clicking the &lt&gt (code) button
                    beforehand.
