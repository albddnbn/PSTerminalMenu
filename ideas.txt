Install-Application:
    - add a parameter or something along those lines, so script will run the function exactly the same way, except it will use the
      -DeploymentType 'Uninstall' parameter value as opposed to 'Install'


All uses of foreach-object - try to use -parallel switch to speed up execution time
  - make foreach block run in parallel instead of one after the other
  (powershell 7)

- in get-targetcomputers and being blocks for report-generating functions

    - Try just using test-connection - if it works, should be a single computer name.
**^This actually does work, but it turns out that I can scrap this whole section, and combine it with the section that
takes the input string and uses it to grab a group of computers.
  - if input string was input with intent to grab one computer - it's only going to be able to grab the one computer
  - if its part of a hostname and not linked to a real hostname itself - it will be used to generate a list.

***SEE IF YOU CAN HAVE FUNCTIONS RUN IN A DIFFERENT TERMINAL WINDOW WHEN THEY ARE CHOSEN
  - would this allow you to go back to the main menu and choose another?

**TEst-WSMan or [System.IO.Directory]::Exists(UNC path) instead of Test-connection
