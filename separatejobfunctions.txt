1. Have filesystemwatcher open in a separate window/powershell process
1A. Pass the absolute path to completed jobs directory to that powershell window like this: -argumentlist "Write-Host $(pwd)"
    - ^ That would write the current working directory OF THE ORIGINAL POWERSHELL WINDOW to the new window terminal.
    - If you run filesystem watcher as a part of the menu.ps1 process, things get tripped up.
