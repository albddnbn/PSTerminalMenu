# --------------- Powershell Menu in Terminal ---------------------------------
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    First, the script using the category names in the 'categories.txt' file to create a hashtable w/the cateogry names as keys. Then, the script creates an array from each of the .txt files in the 'functions' directory (each txt filename corresponds to a function category).
Script generates a menu in the Powershell terminal. Options in the terminal menu are generated, by default, using the functionlist.txt file. The functions (what actually happens when an option is picked) are sourced using (by default) any functions in the the menu_functions.ps1 file, and any .ps1 files in the same directory following the conventional Powershell cmdlet casing format.

.DESCRIPTION
    Using the hashtable, the script first presents a menu of the categories, and after user has selected a category, script presents a second menu with all of the functions in that category. This is to prevent the list getting really long from just having all functions lumped into one category.

.EXAMPLE
    ./menu.ps1 is all that's needed to run script provided that configuration is right.
